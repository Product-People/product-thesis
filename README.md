==============

The product thesis statement (as shared with Product People by Jason Evanish of Kissmetrics)

**Why are we working on <Product Name> next?**

- Includes any market forces and tie into company strategies why we're working on it
- Includes any metrics that are relevant to justify the decision.

**What are the use cases for the <Product Name>?**

- Here we list all the personas that this applies to. Ideally, many of the personas that already use our product will also use this.
- The use cases are intended to be specific enough that the design and engineering team can easily imagine how someone would use the solution they're building and why. 

**What Problems Do We need to Solve? (in order of priority)**

- If this is an existing feature, this will include the known problems with how the feature currently exists and what the problems are behind the use cases above.
- If this is a new feature, this is focused on the core problems that fit in the use cases above.

**What are Future Considerations that must be accounted for?**

-If there is anything we're doing now that applies to future efforts, these are added so engineering and design can keep them in mind as they work on the solution.

**What is our KPI for this Thesis?**

- We choose a KPI to measure success vs. failure of the project. We set a goal improvement on an existing metric (with a baseline measurement) or a new measure that we'd start tracking when we launch
